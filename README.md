I had been working with a lot of frameworks in all of my projects. 
I came across an article a while back in which the importance of not letting frameworks render you "lazy" was emphasized. So I decided to build one of the designs of one of my friends with HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript. I wasn't sure wether to post it on my github beacause I had thought that my journey was supposed to be progressive, and my repo should show the new technologies I learn as I grow. But I am really excited with the way the project turned out. So I decided to upload it!
